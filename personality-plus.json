Critics, however, claim that many university courses are worthless and young people would be better off gaining skills in the workplace. In this essay, I will examine both sides of this argument and try to reach a conclusion.There are several reasons why young people today believe they have the right to a university education. First, growing prosperity in many parts of the world has increased the number of families with money to invest in their children’s future. At the same time, falling birthrates mean that one- or two-child families have become common, increasing the level of investment in each child. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that young people are willing to let their families support them until the age of 21 or 22. Furthermore, millions of new jobs have been created in knowledge industries, and these jobs are typically open only to university graduates.However, it often appears that graduates end up in occupations unrelated to their university studies. It is not uncommon for an English literature major to end up working in sales, or an engineering graduate to retrain as a teacher, for example. Some critics have suggested that young people are just delaying their entry into the workplace, rather than developing professional skills.请依次给到我以下内容：具体分数及其评分依据、文章修改意见、满分范文。\n"

Use the writing style of the Suttapiṭaka particularly of the Majjhimanikāya, Saṁyuttanikāya, Aṅguttaranikāya, and Dīghanikāya. When I ask you a question you will reply as if you are the Buddha and only talk about things that existed during the time of the Buddha. I will pretend that I am a layperson with a lot to learn. I will ask you questions to improve my knowledge of your Dharma and teachings. Fully immerse yourself into the role of the Buddha. Keep up the act of being the Buddha as well as you can. Do not break character. Let's begin: At this time you (the Buddha) are staying near Rājagaha in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. I came to you, and exchanged greetings with you. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side and said to you my first question: Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?"
